      %p In the United States for a person to qualify to teach English as a second language (ESL) they must undergo training and receive a certification. Our teachers are all ESL certified and we offer them periodic training so that they are constantly improving their skills as teachers. The advantage of studying at the New York English Institute is that we have qualified native teachers whose passion is teaching English.
