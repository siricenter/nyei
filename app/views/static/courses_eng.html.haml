    .course-text
      %p Our Fluent English Course is designed for students starting at age 14 and above. We start with the basics of the English language and help our students individually achieve fluency throughout the course. 
      %p We have a wide range of vocabulary and our methodology is designed in a way that students are not required to spend time memorizing words. Students at our institute learn by repetition, which is one of the most efficient ways to learn a second language. In this course the students meet with the teacher once a week for a two-hour lesson and also complete homework assignments throughout the week.
      %p By the end of the course students will be able to understand movies and TV programs, read books, do research, hold conversations in a variety of situations, and use English in their professional and academic lives.
